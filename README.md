# **Predictive Customer Analytics for Retail Businesses**

## **Problem Statement:**
A supermarket chain wants to make smarter decisions about how it serves its current customers, attracts new ones, and manages its product offerings. They have turned to their existing data for answers and are seeking insights that can guide their future strategy.

## **Solution:**
- Using the data that can be found in the “Original Data” folder, K-means clustering was used to develop three models to classify the customers of a supermarket according to their demographics, sales according to their geographics, and products according to their popularity.
- Using the same data, decision trees were used to categorize the data to determine the customers’ churn and loyalty levels.
- The models developed can be found in the “Models” folder.
- A report has also been created to demonstrate, discuss, and analyse the results.
